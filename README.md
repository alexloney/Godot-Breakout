# Godot Breakout

This is my second game implementation for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).
This is an implementation of the [Breakout](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/breakout/) game. In
addition to the standard goals, this also implements the stretch goals of adding color to the bricks in
each row, adding a high score that is kept between plays (though not between runs of the application, but
that would be very simple to add), reduces the paddle size once the ball reaches the ceiling, and even
has a basic sound and animation for when the ball destroys a brick.
